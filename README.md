I made this tool thinking about people with Alexithymia, and for kids who are learning to read and recognize the meaning of words and phrases, and for anyone who want to try it.
This code uses the Microsoft Text Analytics API to analyze the sentiment of a given text, and displays the results both as text and as visual waves. The sentiment can be positive 😃, negative 😔, or neutral 😐.

# Getting Started 🚀
To run this project, you need to have a RapidAPI key for the Microsoft Text Analytics API. You can get it [here](https://rapidapi.com/microsoft-azure-org-microsoft-cognitive-services/api/microsoft-text-analytics1).
Once you have obtained it,
you need to replace YOUR_KEY_HERE in the Javascript files with your RapidAPI key.
# Usage  🤖
To use this application, simply type or paste the text you want to analyze into the text box and the application will automatically display the sentiment of the text. If the text contains multiple sentences, the application will display the sentiment of each sentence as well as the confidence scores for each sentiment.

In addition to displaying the results as text, the application also displays the sentiment of the text as waves using the Sine Waves library. 🌊
# Results  📊
The text sentiment is shown with a certainty score plus accompanying it with waves,the waves will change depending on the type of sentiment it is. 😃😔😐 e.g.:

In addition, you can change the colors according to your personal taste. 🎨
